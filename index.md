## Paw Moo
Hi! I am a student at MSU Denver with a major in environmental science and a minor in biology. I am a 2024 ESIIL Stars student. I am passionate about plants and hope to work in a field of conservation or restoration. My interest in earth science stem from my indigenous/ethnic [Knyaw](https://www.theurbanvillage.org/karenhistory) background. The Knyaw people have always used plants for their medicinal properties and believed in protecting the land their ancestors lived off. I hope to continue my people's legacy of being stewards of the environment.
